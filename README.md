## Sprint Capacity Calculation

The application calculates sprint capacity using the following formula:

```
Total Capacity = (Team Members √ó Sprint Days) - PTO Days - On-Call Days - Rollover Points
```

### Formula Breakdown

- **Team Members √ó Sprint Days**: Base capacity assuming full availability
- **PTO Days**: Total days lost due to planned time off and activities
  - Calculated as: `Œ£(Developers √ó Duration)` for each PTO activity
- **On-Call Days**: Days spent on on-call responsibilities
- **Rollover Points**: Story points from unfinished work in previous sprint

### Example Calculation

For a team of 5 developers in a 10-day sprint:
- Base capacity: `5 √ó 10 = 50 points`
- With 2 developers taking 1 day PTO each: `50 - 2 = 48 points`
- With 1 day of on-call time: `48 - 1 = 47 points`
- With 3 rollover points: `47 - 3 = 44 points`

**Final capacity: 44 story points**

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

The Sprint Planner is built as a Progressive Web App, which means you can install it on your device like a native application:

### Installation
- **Desktop**: Look for the install button in your browser's address bar or menu
- **Mobile**: Add to home screen when prompted or through your browser's menu
- **Offline**: Once installed, the app works offline and syncs when you're back online

### PWA Features
- **App-like Experience**: Full-screen interface without browser UI
- **Fast Loading**: Cached resources for instant startup
- **Offline Support**: Continue using saved configurations even without internet
- **Native Integration**: Appears in your device's app drawer/home screen

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
